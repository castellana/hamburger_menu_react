            <h1>There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!</h1>
            <p>You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Bender, you risked your life to save me! Kif might! It must be wonderful. Now what?</p>
            <p>No, she'll probably make me do it. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. <strong> I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.</strong> <em> Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?</em> We're also Santa Claus!</p>
            <h2>Bender?! You stole the atom.</h2>
            <p>You can see how I lived before I met you. They're like sex, except I'm having them! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Okay, I like a challenge.</li><li>Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!</li><li>Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.</h3>
            <p>Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Guess again.</li><li>Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful!</li><li>Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We're rescuing ya. We're rescuing ya. I wish! It's a nickel. You mean while I'm sleeping in it? No! Don't jump! Really?!</p>
            <p>Hello Morbo, how's the family? You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Bite my shiny metal ass. Fry, we have a crate to deliver.</p>
            <p>You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. Who am I making this out to? Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.</p>
            <p>No, just a regular mistake. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. No, just a regular mistake. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?</p>
            <p>I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Pansy. Do a flip! Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.</p>
            <p>This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! I'll get my kit! And when we woke up, we had these bodies. It doesn't look so shiny to me.</p>
            <p>We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Why not indeed! The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.</p>
            <p>Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!</p>
            <p>Okay, I like a challenge. Can I use the gun? For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!</p>
            <p>Large bet on myself in round one. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! She also liked to shut up! Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."</p>
            <p>Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! I wish! It's a nickel. Fatal. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! No, she'll probably make me do it.</p>
